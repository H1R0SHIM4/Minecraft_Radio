# Minecraft_Radio is a Minecraft Voice Communication Plugin

## Purpose

The purpose of this Minecraft plugin is to introduce a radio receiver and station system within the game. The plugin aims to enhance communication among players on the server, offering an alternative to the chat system while keeping the communication experience relatively close to the vanilla Minecraft environment.

## Installation

To install this plugin on your server, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. First, install the Simple Voicechat plugin on your server.

   - Modrinth: [Simple Voicechat on Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/simple-voice-chat)
   - CurseForge: [Simple Voicechat on CurseForge](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/simple-voice-chat)
   - SpigotMc: [Simple Voicechat on SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/simple-voice-chat.93738/)
   - GitHub: [Simple Voicechat on GitHub](https://github.com/henkelmax/simple-voice-chat)

2. Players will also need to install the 'Simple Voice' mod on their devices.

3. Next, install the RadioPlugin on your server.

4. Run the jar file, and a simple configuration file will be generated. Adjust the settings in the config file if needed.

5. That's it! The plugin is now installed and ready to use on your server.

## Usage
This plugin recognizes two structures: receivers (radio receivers) and players with levers (radio stations).

If the wave matches on a radio station and a radio receiver, the voices of players near the radio station will be transmitted to all radio stations set to the same wave.

To configure the wave, a player needs to:

- Shift and right-click on the radio player block.
- Scroll the mouse wheel up or down to increase or decrease the wave.
